# Predicting Wine Score Capstone Project

## Project Overview
In this project, we use Azure and Azure ML studio to create cloud-based ML pipelines, which are easily automated and updatable. We create train models using AutoML, then choose and deploy the best model. The model endpoints are then consumed via REST API calls.
